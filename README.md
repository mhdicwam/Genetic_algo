Genetic algorithms are a class of algorithms that take inspiration from genetics. More specifically, “genes” evolve over
several iterations by both crossover (reproduction) and mutation.It’s basically make x guesses, create y hybrid guess,
evaluate the fitness of the gene pool and do some pruning. Rinse and repeat until you converge on a solution. The Reader
should have a basic understanding of how GA works. If not, please read this article titled “Introduction to Optimization

## General info

in this project we treated two uses cases : "traveling salesman problem”" and "the MasterMind game" to illustrate how
the genetic algorithm can solve some real life problems. To solve a Genetic
